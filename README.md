# Integration of Machine Learning in Encroachment-Identification

Abstract: 

Machine Learning in Encroachment Detection: The study explores the integration of machine 
learning as a tool in the identification of land encroachments, which could be applied globally. It 
highlights the inefficiency of the traditional methods and proposes a Machine Learning model 
using high resolution satellite imagery for improved accuracy and speed. The study also 
discusses about the growing issue of urban encroachment due to rapid population growth, 
inadequate housing and weak land management, leading to environmental and social 
conflicts. The is determined to follow the path involving demarcation ofan  area of study, 
preparation of data sets for training the ML model and validation of the ML model. The aim is 
to create an efficient model for encroachment identification. The findings from the model can 
significantly aid the urban authorities in managing encroachment, contributing to a smarter 
city planning and sustainable urban development.
